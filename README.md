CKEditor is a WYSIWYG rich text editor which enables writing content directly inside of web pages or online
applications. Its core code is written in JavaScript and it is developed by CKSource. CKEditor is available under open
source and commercial licenses.

This extension is now obsolete due to the lack of native dark mode feature. It will be replaced by
[CKEditor 5](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.c-k-editor) extension in the future. This extension was last updated to work
with [Panel](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.panel) version 3.0.0 and that’s it. I’ll leave this up to the contributors
if they want to keep this extension compatible with future versions of Panel.
